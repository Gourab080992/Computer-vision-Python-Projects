# Computer-vision-Python-Project(shredder machine/saw mill project)
 An use case where the AI has to identify or detect the hand (closed and open plamed hand)and sound an alarm if the hand reaches a machine dangeroulsy close.
 This project draws two virtiual lines on the screen one of which signifies the line of danger and the other denotes the machine line(whre the saw or shredder is), when  the hand   crosses the line of dander the alarm is sounded.It was implemented in a saw-mill and by deploying it on a google coral machine and the alarm signal was replaced by a replay which turned off the power saw once the
 arm crossed the danger line as marked on the screen.
